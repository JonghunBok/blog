[Test Driven Development with Vue.js by Sarah Dayan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD1fEhcEzY8)

"Testing is one of the pillars of writing robust software."
"Tests should give you confidence taht you aren't shipping broken software."

"Do I care about this if it changes?"
if so, test it!

Your software's contract is infinitely more important
than the way you implement it.
-> Don't skip the green step.
